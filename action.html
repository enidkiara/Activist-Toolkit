      <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
      <p>
        There are many ways you can help make a difference and fight overconsumption. Whether it’s changing your own habits or joining others in bigger efforts, every action counts. Here are some simple steps you can take to start making an impact today:
      </p>
      <div class="help">
      <h3>Change Your Habits</h3>
      <p>Changing your own habits is a great place to start. Try to buy less and only what you truly need, and focus on choosing higher-quality, longer-lasting products. Shopping second-hand, repairing items instead of throwing them away, and avoiding impulse purchases are all simple ways to make a big difference.</p>

      <h3>Support Better Businesses</h3>
      <p>Supporting better businesses also helps. Choose to buy from companies that are ethical, sustainable, and transparent about how they treat workers and the environment. Avoid fast fashion and brands known for exploiting people or harming the planet, and instead support local or eco-friendly businesses.</p>

      <h3>Raise Awareness</h3>
      <p>Raising awareness is another powerful step. Share information about overconsumption with friends, family, and on social media to help others understand the issue. You can also host or attend events, workshops, or screenings to spark more conversations in your community.</p>

      <h3>Get Involved in Advocacy</h3>
      <p>Getting involved in advocacy can create long-term change. Support policies and laws that protect workers’ rights and the environment. Sign petitions, join campaigns, and consider volunteering with or donating to organizations that are working for sustainability and justice.</p>

     <h3>Build Community</h3>
     <p>Finally, building community can make your efforts stronger. Join or start local groups focused on sustainable living, like minimalism or zero-waste. Organize events like clothing swaps or repair workshops, and encourage those around you to think critically about their own consumption habits.</p>
