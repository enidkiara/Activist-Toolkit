          <h1>Buy Less, Live More</h1>
        <p>Big companies are pushing you to buy more than you need, and it’s costing more than just money.

      <p>Big companies have designed a system that encourages people to buy more and more, even when they don’t need to. Through clever advertising, emotional manipulation, and endless product releases, corporations push consumers into a cycle of overconsumption. This benefits their profits, but it comes at a high cost to individuals, communities, and the planet.</p>

    <p>  Overconsumption leaves many people stressed, in debt, and feeling like they can never “keep up.” It also generates massive amounts of waste and pollution, filling landfills, harming ecosystems, and using up natural resources at an unsustainable rate. The fast pace of production and disposal also exploits workers and damages vulnerable communities around the world. </p>

     <p> This isn’t just about individual choices, it’s about a culture created by powerful industries that profit from keeping people buying endlessly. By exposing these hidden tactics and understanding their impact, we can start to break the cycle and choose smarter, more responsible ways to live.Big companies have designed a system that encourages people to buy more and more, even when they don’t need to.
