      <p>
        Hi, my name is Kiara and I created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I was motivated to work on this because I’ve seen how big companies use advertising and manipulation to convince people to keep buying more, even though it’s hurting the environment. I wanted to shine a light on the hidden impacts of overconsumption and show how much power we really have to make smarter, more sustainable choices. </p>

       <p> Through this project, I’ve learned how deeply consumerism affects individuals, communities, and our planet — and how little most people realize what’s going on behind the scenes. My goal is to help others understand the issue, break the cycle, and feel confident making decisions that are better for them and the world.</p>

       <p> Thanks for visiting and taking the time to learn more. Together we can create a future that’s more mindful, balanced, and sustainable
