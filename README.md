# Activist-Toolkit

## What This Project Is / Does
This project is a website that shows how fast fashion is harming the planet and gives tips on how to make more sustainable clothing choices. You’ll learn about the waste, pollution, and unfair labor behind cheap clothes, and find simple ways to make better choices, like thrifting, upcycling, and supporting eco-friendly brands.

## Why I Made This Project
I made this project to raise awareness about the hidden costs of cheap clothing. Many people don’t realize how their clothing choices affect the environment and the lives of workers, so I wanted to create a resource that’s easy to understand and act on.

## How I Made This Project
I built the website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I organized information into sections about waste, pollution, and labor practices, and added tips for sustainable choices. I focused on making the site clear, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

## Challenges and What I Learned
One of the hardest parts was presenting a lot of information without overwhelming users. I learned a lot about web design, like structuring content, using color effectively, and making the site interactive. I also learned more about fast fashion itself and ways people can make a positive impact.
